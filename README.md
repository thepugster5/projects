# THEPUGSTER5 REPOSITORY

A simple repository filled with my projects so I can play them across devices.

## Projects (so far)
- Clicker Game v1 - A simple clicker game with interactive buttons that has moderate CSS and focuses more on the little details.
- Clicker Game v2 - Another clicker game which focuses more on working mechanics rather than CSS.
- Clicker Game v3 - Yet another one which had a UI overhaul and has some SFX.
- Clicker Game v4 - It's just... better.
- Many more to come...
